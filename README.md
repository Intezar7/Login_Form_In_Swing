Swing SignUp Form Project
The Swing SignUp Form project is a simple Java application that provides a user-friendly graphical interface for user registration and login. It utilizes the Swing library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the user to enter their details and access the application.

Project Components
Login
The project starts with a login screen that allows existing users to enter their credentials to access the application. Users are required to provide a username and password. If any of these fields are left empty, an error message is displayed. Upon successful login, users are directed to a "Welcome Back" screen.


Features
1) User-friendly GUI for login and account creation.
2) Validation for empty fields on both the login and SignUp screens.
3) Clear navigation between login, account creation, and the welcome screen.
